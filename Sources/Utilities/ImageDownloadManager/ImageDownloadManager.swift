    /// 3. If image is not found, then it tries to download the image from the url.
    /// 4. While image is being downloaded, the progressHandler is called multiple times **on background thread**, until the image is downloaded.
    /// 5. After the image is downloaded, it calls the imageProcessor closure to process image. **Note, this closure is called on backgrond thread.** And then save the processed image to both file system cache and memory cache.
    /// 6. And the completion closure is called **on the main thread**.
    /// 7. Before retrieving image from memory cache, and before completion closure is called, the image will be decoded to bitmap first. Then it is rendered on screen faster.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - url: the url of image
    ///   - imageProcessor: a closure to process image. It is called on background thread.

    ///   - completion: a closure is called on main thread after the downloading is finished.
    ///   - image: the image downloaded or nil.
    ///   - error: If the image is failed to be downloaded, the error will be included in this parameter. Otherwise, it is nil.
